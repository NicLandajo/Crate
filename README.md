Crate is a 3D browser for Nuke that generates thumbnails from geometry and gaussian splats automatically for you.
#
Always check the releases page for the latest version of Crate.: https://github.com/NicLandajo/Crate/releases
#
No more guesswork, just thumbnails, making it easier than ever to find, organize, and access your 3D resources.
Double-click and the asset will instantly appear in the nodegraph.
Forget about creating cache images in your OS explorer, Crate does everything for you in the background right inside Nuke.

Crate is a set of Python scripts designed to work with F3D, a fast and minimalist 3D viewer, to provide asset browsing capabilities for splats and geometry in Nuke.
