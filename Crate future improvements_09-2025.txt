FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

-thumbs folders in main root directory to navigate folders by looking at the content visually, whitout the need of reading the folder name first (will be implemented only if it works snappy fast)
-exr thumbnails 
-hdr thumbnails
-abc geometry to support older HDF format for thumb generation if possible. Not a priority.
-a way to feed Crate library of objects and splats with an export/import simple panel directly from Nuke.
-direct embeded of F3D viewer window inside Crate interface, by putting the current library navigation panel on the left and the F3D window on the right. Final check with F3D license to confirm if possible.
